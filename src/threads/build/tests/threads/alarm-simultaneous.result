FAIL
Test output failed to match any acceptable form.

Acceptable output:
  (alarm-simultaneous) begin
  (alarm-simultaneous) Creating 3 threads to sleep 5 times each.
  (alarm-simultaneous) Each thread sleeps 10 ticks each time.
  (alarm-simultaneous) Within an iteration, all threads should wake up on the same tick.
  (alarm-simultaneous) iteration 0, thread 0: woke up after 10 ticks
  (alarm-simultaneous) iteration 0, thread 1: woke up 0 ticks later
  (alarm-simultaneous) iteration 0, thread 2: woke up 0 ticks later
